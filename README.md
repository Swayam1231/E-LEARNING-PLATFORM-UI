I designed and built this E-Learning Platform User Interface using core front-end technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — to simulate the layout and functionality of a basic online learning environment.
The goal of this project was to create a clean, responsive, and interactive user interface where learners can browse courses, track their progress, and watch embedded video lessons — all within a single web experience. I developed the project entirely in VS Code, without relying on frameworks.
